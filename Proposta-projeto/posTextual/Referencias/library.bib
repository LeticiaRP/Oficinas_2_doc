@article{Bouraine2023,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of local navigation for autonomous mobile robots in partially observable dynamic environments. The main contribution of this work is the expansion of a sampling based approach to deal with the robot and environment dynamic constraints and integrate a safety distance to keep the robot away from collisions. The developed algorithm has been implemented on a robotic platform with a Robot Operating System based embedded architecture, where it has been tested and validated in an indoor environment.},

@inproceedings{Murat2017,
abstract = {In this paper, design of an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) adapted for robot operating system (ROS) is presented by considering both the hardware architecture and electronic communication protocols. Initially the purpose of the robot has been determined, and then the required components to construct the robot have been obtained. After mounting the electronic and mechanic hardware components on the platform, the required interconnections, data exchange system and software have been installed. Then the required tests have been run on the platform and some solutions methods have been proposed for the problems encountered during the tests. The results obtained and experience gained in the design of the platform have been quite satisfactory and will be a guiding light for future works.},
